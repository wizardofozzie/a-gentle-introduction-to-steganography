\section{Introduction}
Steganography is the art and science of writing hidden messages in such a way
that no one, apart from the sender nd intended recipient, suspects the
existence of the message, a form of security through obscurity. Consequently,
functions provided by Stéganô only hide message, without encryption. Indeed
steganography is often used with cryptography.

The advantage of steganography, over cryptography alone, is that messages do
not attract attention to themselves.

Some steganography techniques:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Physical steganography;
    \item Digital steganography;
    \item Network steganography;
    \item Printed steganography.
\end{itemize}

We will dive into digital steganography.
